# Hi, I'm Wafee Rahman

Welcome to my github page, which is filling in for my portfolio website for now.

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University with a strong passion for software development and problem-solving. My coding journey began in high school with the Turing programming language, progressing to Python and Java in subsequent years. Outside of coursework, I actively work on diverse projects that enhance my technical skills and solve some of my first-world problems, as showcased in my GitHub repository, providing me with hands-on experience using various technologies ranging from ReactJS to  databases like MongoDB and MySQL for the backend development. When I'm not committing to projects to build skills, I frequently tackle LeetCode problems and commit their solutions to their respective repositiories here, following structured roadmaps such as the Neetcode 150 to help hone my skills in DSA.

Right now, I'm an Intern at TD Insurance working in the Digitization, Automation, and Workflow team. I offer my technical background to help support project delivery and management of automation releases. I also offer my skills in delivering effective automations that helps save time in our workflows, as well as conducting root cause analysis on backend defects in Guidewire PCBC. I'm also an incoming software engineer intern at TD Securities, where I hope to gain adept skills in backend software development in a technical environment. 

Looking ahead, Iâ€™m eager to expand my skills in machine learning and computer vision. My next projects will likely explore these fields, potentially integrating full-stack aspects to stay sharp while still looking to learn new frameworks like Spring Boot. My latest project, ClipShare, marks the culmination of my recent focus on full-stack development, setting the stage for this next chapter in my learning journey.

## Recent Projects I've Worked On...

### Explore Toronto - Fullstack Application
- **Description:** A Full Stack Web App for posting and reviewing tourist locations in Toronto. I created it to help me keep track of nice places and restaurants I've been to in Toronto, giving them a score and comments. The site has multi-user and multi-post support, similar to sites like instagram, or yelp. 
- **Tech:** MongoDB, Express, Node, React CSS, EJS, Cloudinary, Mapbox API

### ClipShare Library - Cloud Fullstack Web Application
- **Description:** A full-stack app that allows users to view and upload short videos through cloud video processing services. I created it to help me archive gaming clips and other memories onto the cloud, while being able to view them in an entertaining format, somewhat like youtube or tiktok. 
- **Tech:** React, Firebase, NextJS, TypeScript, Docker, Google Cloud Platform

Feel free to check out my other previous works such as HalalFoods or Hang, the predecessor to ExploreToronto, aswell!

## Certifications

**Udemy Fullstack Web Development 2023 Course**
- **Description:** Comprehensive course covering HTML, CSS, MongoDB, JavaScript, Async JS, and React.
- **Issued By:** Udemy
