# Hi, I'm Wafee Rahman

[Email](mailto:wafee.rahman842@gmail.com) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wafee-rahman-772108270/)

Welcome to my github page, which is filling in for my portfolio website for now.

I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science and am currently entering my third year of studies at Toronto Metropolitan University. I started coding in tenth grade with the Turing programming language, moving into Python and Java in the respective years after. Outside of coursework, I try to build a variety of different projects that help me gain exposure and sharpen my software development skills with a variety of technologies and frameworks, while also providing me with a convenient solution to a first-world problem I have. As you can see in my repository, I'm well into full-stack development, creating projects that help familiarize me with project delivery and exposure to development with technology ranging from frontend frameworks like ReactJS to backend NoSQL/SQL databases like MongoDB and MySQL. When not committing to projects on GitHub, I like to commit to leetcode solutions to my respective repositories, with roadmaps such as the neetcode 150 to guide me in maintaining essential skills. 

Right now, I'm an Intern at TD Insurance working in the Digitization, Automation, and Workflow team. I offer my technical background to help support project delivery and management of automation releases. I also offer my skills in delivering effective automations that helps save time in our workflows, as well as conducting root cause analysis on backend defects in Guidewire PCBC. I'm also an incoming software engineer intern at TD Securities, where I hope to gain adept skills in backend software development in a technical environment. 

As for the future, I'd like to move into building skills in machine learning, aswell as computer vision, as I'm exploring different points of interest in computer science. Projects in both topics will most likely be the next thing I work on with my latest project, clipshare, being my last fullstack project for a while. I may still bring fullstack aspects into my next projects, as I'm looking to keep my full-stack skills sharpened while learning new frameworks, such as springboot.

## Recent Projects I've Worked On...

### Explore Toronto - Fullstack Application
- **Description:** A Full Stack Web App for posting and reviewing tourist locations in Toronto. I created it to help me keep track of nice places and restaurants I've been to in Toronto, giving them a score and comments. The site has multi-user and multi-post support, similar to sites like instagram, or yelp. 
- **Tech:** MongoDB, Express, Node, React CSS, EJS, Cloudinary, Mapbox API

### ClipShare Library - Cloud Fullstack Web Application
- **Description:** A full-stack app that allows users to view and upload short videos through cloud video processing services. I created it to help me archive gaming clips and other memories onto the cloud, while being able to view them in an entertaining format, somewhat like youtube or tiktok. 
- **Tech:** React, Firebase, NextJS, TypeScript, Docker, Google Cloud Platform

Feel free to check out my other previous works such as HalalFoods or Hang, the predecessor to ExploreToronto, aswell!

## Certifications

**Udemy Fullstack Web Development 2023 Course**
- **Description:** Comprehensive course covering HTML, CSS, MongoDB, JavaScript, Async JS, and React.
- **Issued By:** Udemy
